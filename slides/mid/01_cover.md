## Speaker Notes

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'll be presenting our mid-term progress on the Truck Transportation Problem project. This project explores graph algorithms for solving a classic problem from the Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics (NOIP) 2013.

We're investigating two different algorithmic approaches: Binary Lifting and Heavy-Light Decomposition. Currently, we've successfully implemented and tested the first method, while the second method is in the algorithm analysis phase.

The presentation will take approximately 15 minutes, and I'll be happy to answer questions at the end.
