### Speaker Notes

Let me summarize our progress at this mid-term point. We've completed several key milestones. We thoroughly analyzed the problem and designed our algorithmic approach. The Maximum Spanning Tree implementation using Kruskal's algorithm is complete and tested. Most importantly, Method 1 using Binary Lifting is fully implemented, tested, and benchmarked with excellent results.

Currently, we're in the process of implementing Method 2. We've completed the algorithm design and theoretical analysis for Heavy-Light Decomposition, and we're now working on the actual code implementation. We're also continuously refactoring and optimizing our existing code.

Looking ahead, our remaining tasks include finishing the Method 2 implementation and testing it thoroughly. Once both methods are complete, we'll conduct a comprehensive comparative performance analysis to validate our theoretical predictions. Finally, we'll prepare the final documentation and project report.

### Speaker Notes

Here's our project timeline. During weeks 1 through 4, we focused on problem research, algorithm design, and implementing Method 1. This phase is now complete with successful results.

We're currently in weeks 5 and 6, where we've completed the theoretical analysis of Method 2 and are beginning its implementation. This is exactly where we planned to be at the mid-term point.

For weeks 7 through 9, our focus will be completing the Method 2 implementation and conducting comprehensive testing. We'll run both methods on large-scale test data to validate our complexity analysis and compare practical performance.

In the final weeks, 10 and 11, we'll refine and optimize our code, complete all documentation, write the final report, and prepare our final presentation.

We expect to complete the entire project by the end of week 11, which is on schedule with our original plan.

## Slide 3: Key Learnings and Challenges

### Slide Content

**Key Learnings So Far**

**Technical Insights:**
- Importance of problem transformation (graph → tree)
- Trade-offs between implementation complexity and theoretical optimality
- Value of thorough testing for correctness validation

**Practical Experience:**
- Union-Find optimization techniques (path compression, union by rank)
- Bit manipulation for efficient exponentiation
- Python performance considerations for algorithm implementation

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Handling disconnected graphs (forest vs tree)
- Edge vs node attribute handling in tree structures
- Balancing code clarity with performance

---

### Speaker Notes

Let me share some key learnings from this project so far. On the technical side, we've gained deep appreciation for problem transformation - how converting a complex graph problem into a tree problem can make it tractable. We've learned firsthand about the trade-offs between implementation complexity and theoretical optimality. And we've seen how thorough testing is essential for validating correctness, especially with complex algorithms.

Practically, we've gained hands-on experience with advanced data structure optimization techniques, like path compression and union by rank in Union-Find. We've learned to use bit manipulation for efficient computation with powers of two. And we've discovered important lessons about Python performance considerations when implementing algorithms.

We've also encountered and overcome several challenges. Handling disconnected graphs required us to think about forests rather than single trees. Managing edge attributes in tree structures led us to explore the virtual node technique for Method 2. And throughout the project, we've constantly balanced the need for code clarity with performance requirements.

### Speaker Notes

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the project, our implementation approach, the algorithms, or our future plans.

Some areas you might want to ask about include the details of our implementation, how we handled specific edge cases, our testing methodology, or our thoughts on when to use each algorithm in practice.

I'd also be interested in hearing any suggestions you might have for our remaining work, particularly regarding the Heavy-Light Decomposition implementation or our comparative analysis plans.
