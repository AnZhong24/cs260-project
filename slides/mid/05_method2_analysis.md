**Method 2: Heavy-Light Decomposition**

**Status:** Algorithm design and analysis phase (not yet implemented)

**Core Idea:** Decompose the tree into "heavy" and "light" chains for efficient path queries

**Key Concepts:**
- **Heavy child:** The child with largest subtree
- **Light child:** All other children
- **Heavy path:** Maximal path of heavy edges
- **Property:** Any root-to-node path crosses at most O(log n) light edges

**Result:** O(log n) time to "jump" between chains to find LCA

### Speaker Notes

Now let me discuss our second method: Heavy-Light Decomposition, or HLD. I want to emphasize that this method is currently in the algorithm design and analysis phase - we have not yet implemented it in code.

The core idea of HLD is to decompose the tree into chains based on subtree sizes. For each node, we identify its "heavy child" - the child with the largest subtree. All other children are "light children." We then form "heavy paths" by connecting nodes to their heavy children.

The key property that makes this powerful is that any path from the root to any node crosses at most O(log n) light edges. This is because each time we cross a light edge going downward, we enter a subtree that's at most half the size of the previous subtree. So we can only cross light edges logarithmically many times.

This property allows us to "jump" between chains efficiently, achieving O(log n) time for LCA queries.

## Slide 2: Virtual Node Technique

### Slide Content

**Virtual Node Transformation**

**Problem:** HLD naturally works with node queries, but we need edge queries

**Solution:** Transform edges into virtual nodes!

**During MST Construction:**
- Instead of directly connecting components A and B
- Create a virtual node V storing the edge weight
- Connect: A ← V → B
- Virtual node becomes the new component root

**Example:**
```
Before: City1 --[weight=10]-- City2
After:       VirtualNode(10)
            /                \
        City1              City2
```

**Key insight:** LCA of two cities will be a virtual node whose value is the path bottleneck!

---

### Speaker Notes

One clever technique we'll use in HLD is the virtual node transformation. The challenge is that HLD naturally operates on nodes, but our problem requires querying edge weights along paths.

The solution is elegant: during MST construction, whenever we need to connect two components A and B with an edge of weight w, instead of connecting them directly, we create a virtual node V that stores the weight w. This virtual node then connects A and B, and becomes the new root of the merged component.

Here's a simple example: instead of directly connecting City 1 and City 2 with an edge of weight 10, we create a virtual node storing the value 10, and this node has City 1 and City 2 as its children.

The beautiful property this gives us is that when we query for the path between two cities, their LCA will be a virtual node, and that virtual node's stored value will be exactly the bottleneck weight we're looking for! This is because edges with smaller weights are added later in Kruskal's algorithm, so they correspond to virtual nodes higher up in the tree.

## Slide 3: HLD Algorithm Steps

### Slide Content

**Algorithm Steps**

**Preprocessing (two DFS passes):**

**DFS 1:** Compute tree properties
- Subtree sizes
- Depth of each node
- Parent pointers
- Heavy child for each node

**DFS 2:** Decompose into chains
- Assign each node to a chain
- Record chain head for each node

**Time:** O(n) total preprocessing

**Query:** Jump chains to find LCA
- While nodes on different chains, jump to parent chain
- When on same chain, return the higher node
- Time: O(log n) per query

---

### Speaker Notes

The HLD algorithm consists of two preprocessing DFS passes followed by efficient queries.

In the first DFS, we compute basic tree properties: subtree sizes, depths, parent pointers, and identify the heavy child for each node. This is straightforward tree traversal.

In the second DFS, we actually decompose the tree into chains. We assign each node to a chain and record the head of its chain. Heavy children stay on their parent's chain, while light children start new chains.

The beautiful thing about this preprocessing is that it's entirely linear time - just O(n) total. This is better than binary lifting's O(n log n) preprocessing.

For queries, we use a simple chain-jumping technique. While the two nodes are on different chains, we move the node on the deeper chain up to its chain head's parent. Because we cross at most O(log n) light edges, this process takes O(log n) time. Once both nodes are on the same chain, the higher one is the LCA.

## Slide 4: Theoretical Analysis

### Slide Content

**Complexity Analysis**

| Metric | Binary Lifting | Heavy-Light Decomp |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Preprocessing | O(n log n) | **O(n)** ✓ |
| Query Time | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| Space | O(n log n) | **O(n)** ✓ |

**Theoretical Advantages:**
- ✓ Faster preprocessing (linear vs. linearithmic)
- ✓ Lower space complexity (linear vs. linearithmic)
- ✓ Extensible to path updates, subtree queries
- ✓ Can be combined with segment trees for dynamic operations

**Trade-off:**
- ✗ More complex to implement correctly
- ✗ Larger constant factors in practice
- ✗ Harder to debug

---

### Speaker Notes

Let's compare the theoretical complexity of both methods. For preprocessing, HLD achieves linear O(n) time compared to binary lifting's O(n log n). Both methods achieve O(log n) query time, so they're equivalent for individual queries. However, HLD uses only O(n) space compared to binary lifting's O(n log n), which can be significant for very large trees.

Beyond just this problem, HLD has theoretical advantages in extensibility. It naturally supports more complex operations like path updates and subtree queries. It can be combined with segment trees to support dynamic modifications to the tree. This makes it a more powerful tool in general.

However, there are trade-offs. HLD is significantly more complex to implement correctly. The code is longer and involves subtle details that are easy to get wrong. The constant factors hidden in the O(n) and O(log n) can be larger in practice. And debugging HLD code is notoriously difficult.

This is why we chose to implement binary lifting first - it gives us a working solution while we carefully design the more complex HLD approach.
