## Actual Word Counts by Section

| Section | File | Speaker Notes | Target | Status |
|---------|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| 1. Cover | 01_cover.md | 92 words | 40 | ⚠️ Over |
| 2. Background | 02_background.md | 338 words | 160 | ⚠️ Over |
| 3. Algorithm Idea | 03_algorithm_idea.md | 330 words | 160 | ⚠️ Over |
| 4. Method 1 | 04_method1_implementation.md | 727 words | 320 | ⚠️ Over |
| 5. Method 2 | 05_method2_analysis.md | 641 words | 240 | ⚠️ Over |
| 6. Comparison | 06_comparison.md | 391 words | 160 | ⚠️ Over |
| 7. Progress | 07_progress_plan.md | 471 words | 120 | ⚠️ Over |
| **TOTAL** | | **2,990 words** | **1,200** | **⚠️ 2.5x over** |

## Analysis

**Current Status:** The total speaker notes contain approximately **2,990 words**, which would take about **37 minutes** at 80 words/minute.

**Issue:** This is **2.5 times longer** than the 15-minute target.

## Recommendations for Adjustment

### Option 1: Faster Speaking Pace (Not Recommended)
- Speak at ~200 words/minute (very fast, difficult to follow)
- Not ideal for technical content

### Option 2: Selective Content Reduction (Recommended)
Trim approximately **1,800 words** by focusing on key points:

#### Specific Cuts to Make:

**1. Cover (92 → 40 words):**
- Keep it brief: project title, your name, quick intro
- Cut: -52 words

**2. Background (338 → 180 words):**
- Reduce example explanations
- Combine slides 2 and 3 narratives
- Cut: -158 words

**3. Algorithm Idea (330 → 200 words):**
- Shorten proof explanation
- Reduce Kruskal description (assume basic knowledge)
- Cut: -130 words

**4. Method 1 (727 → 400 words):**
- Reduce DP recurrence explanation
- Shorten query steps (focus on high-level)
- Condense test results discussion
- Abbreviate pros/cons section
- Cut: -327 words

**5. Method 2 (641 → 350 words):**
- Since not implemented, focus on key concepts only
- Reduce virtual node explanation
- Shorten HLD algorithm steps
- Cut: -291 words

**6. Comparison (391 → 200 words):**
- Make comparison more concise
- Focus on key differences only
- Cut: -191 words

**7. Progress (471 → 230 words):**
- Streamline progress summary
- Reduce timeline details
- Shorten learnings section
- Cut: -241 words

**Total Cuts:** 52 + 158 + 130 + 327 + 291 + 191 + 241 = **1,390 words**

**New Total:** 2,990 - 1,390 = **1,600 words** (≈ 20 minutes)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Most Practical)
1. **Prepare full notes** (current 2,990 words) as reference
2. **Mark essential points** to cover in presentation (~1,200 words)
3. **Practice with timer** and adjust on the fly
4. **Save detailed explanations** for Q&A

## Time Allocation Recommendation (Strict 15-min version)

| Section | Time | Words | Slides |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Cover | 0.5 min | 40 | 1 |
| Background | 2 min | 160 | 2-3 |
| Algorithm Idea | 2 min | 160 | 2 |
| Method 1 | 4 min | 320 | 4-5 |
| Method 2 | 2.5 min | 200 | 3-4 |
| Comparison | 2 min | 160 | 2 |
| Progress | 2 min | 160 | 2-3 |
| **Total** | **15 min** | **1,200** | **16-20** |

---

## Action Items

1. ✓ **Current files are comprehensive** - keep as detailed reference
2. ☐ **Create condensed version** for actual 15-minute delivery
3. ☐ **Practice with timer** to identify natural cut points
4. ☐ **Prepare backup slides** for extended Q&A or 20-minute version
5. ☐ **Mark "must cover" vs "if time permits"** in notes

---

## Final Recommendation

**Do NOT rewrite all files.** The current detailed speaker notes are valuable for:
- Understanding the full content
- Answering detailed questions
- Adapting to different time constraints
- Future reference

**Instead:**
- Use current notes as comprehensive guide
- During actual presentation, focus on key points only
- Skip technical details that audiences can read in slides
- Let visuals do more of the explanation work
- Reserve depth for Q&A session

**With practice and natural pacing, you can deliver the key insights in 15 minutes while having the detailed notes as backup.**
