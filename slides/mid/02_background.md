# Background & Problem Description

## Slide 1: Project Background

### Slide Content

**Project Background**

- **Origin:** NOIP 2013 (National Olympiad in Informatics, China)
- **Problem Domain:** Graph Theory
- **Key Algorithms:**
  - Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)
  - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- **Classic Application:** Combining MST with tree queries

### Speaker Notes

This project is based on the "Truck Transportation" problem from the 2013 Chinese National Olympiad in Informatics. It's a classic problem that beautifully combines two fundamental graph algorithms: Maximum Spanning Tree construction and Lowest Common Ancestor queries.

The problem is particularly interesting because it demonstrates how we can transform a complex graph problem into a simpler tree problem, and then apply efficient tree algorithms to solve it. This is a common paradigm in competitive programming and algorithm design.

## Slide 2: Problem Description

### Slide Content

**Problem Scenario**

- **Setting:** Country A with n cities and m bidirectional roads
- **Constraint:** Each road has a weight limit (maximum load capacity)
- **Task:** Process q truck queries
  - Each truck needs to travel from city x to city y
  - Determine the maximum cargo weight the truck can carry

**Key Insight:** The truck's capacity is limited by the weakest road (bottleneck) on its path

---

### Speaker Notes

Let me describe the problem scenario. We have a country with n cities connected by m bidirectional roads. Each road has a weight limit, representing the maximum load it can support.

We need to answer q queries, where each query asks: for a truck traveling from city x to city y, what's the maximum cargo weight it can carry?

The crucial insight here is the bottleneck effect - similar to the barrel principle. The truck's maximum capacity is determined by the weakest road along its entire path. So we're not just looking for any path from x to y, we're looking for the path whose bottleneck - the minimum edge weight along that path - is as large as possible.

## Slide 3: Problem Formalization

### Slide Content

**Formal Problem Statement**

Given:
- Graph G = (V, E) with n vertices, m edges
- Each edge e has weight w(e) (capacity limit)
- q queries: (x, y)

Find: For each query (x, y)
- Maximum value of min{w(e) : e ∈ path(x,y)}
- Over all possible paths from x to y
- Return -1 if x and y are not connected

**Example:**
```
Path 1: x → a → y,  weights [10, 5]  → bottleneck = 5
Path 2: x → b → y,  weights [8, 8]   → bottleneck = 8 ✓ (better)
```

---

### Speaker Notes

Let me formalize this mathematically. We're given a graph G with n vertices and m edges, where each edge has a weight representing its capacity limit. For each query asking about the route from city x to city y, we need to find the maximum possible value of the minimum edge weight across all paths connecting these two cities.

Here's a simple example to illustrate: suppose we have two paths from x to y. The first path goes through node a with edge weights 10 and 5, so its bottleneck is 5. The second path goes through node b with edge weights 8 and 8, giving a bottleneck of 8. Clearly, the second path is better because it can support heavier cargo.

If two cities are not connected at all, we return -1.

## Visual Design Notes

### Slide 1
- Simple bullet points with icons
- Consider a small graph diagram showing MST + LCA concept

### Slide 2
- Diagram showing cities (nodes) connected by roads (edges) with weight labels
- Highlight a truck and a path with the bottleneck edge
- Use visual metaphor: barrel with different stave heights

### Slide 3
- Graph diagram with two paths highlighted in different colors
- Show the calculation of min edge weight for each path
- Emphasize the better path visually (e.g., thicker line or green color)
