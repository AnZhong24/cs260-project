- **Status:** 2.5× over target

**Recommendations Provided:**
1. Keep current detailed notes as comprehensive reference
2. Practice with timer to identify natural cut points
3. Focus on key points during actual presentation
4. Use detailed notes for Q&A and deeper discussions
5. Specific word reduction targets for each section if strict 15-min needed

**Rationale:**
- Detailed notes are valuable for thorough preparation
- Presenter can naturally condense during actual delivery
- Provides flexibility for different time constraints
- Covers all important points with backup details
