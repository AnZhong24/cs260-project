# Core Algorithm Approach

## Slide 1: Key Observation

### Slide Content

**Key Observation**

**Theorem:** The optimal path (with maximum bottleneck capacity) between any two nodes always exists on the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) of the original graph.

**Why this works:**
1. MST construction prioritizes largest edges
2. For any edge not in MST, there exists a tree path with all edges ≥ that edge
3. Therefore, the tree path has a bottleneck ≥ any alternative path

**Consequence:** We can transform the problem from searching in a complex graph to querying on a simple tree structure!

### Speaker Notes

Now let's look at the key algorithmic insight that makes this problem tractable. There's a beautiful theorem here: the optimal path between any two nodes - that is, the path with the maximum bottleneck capacity - always exists on the Maximum Spanning Tree of the original graph.

Why does this work? When we build a Maximum Spanning Tree, we greedily select the largest edges that don't create cycles. Now, consider any edge that's not in our MST. By the properties of MST construction, there must exist a path in the tree connecting its endpoints, and all edges on this path have weights greater than or equal to this excluded edge. Otherwise, the excluded edge would have been selected instead.

This means that for any non-tree path we might consider, the tree path has an equal or better bottleneck. Therefore, we can safely transform our problem from searching in a potentially complex graph with cycles to simply querying paths on a tree structure. This is a massive simplification!

## Slide 2: Solution Framework

### Slide Content

**Two-Step Solution Framework**

**Step 1: Build Maximum Spanning Tree**
- Use Kruskal's algorithm
- Sort edges by weight (descending)
- Greedily add edges that don't form cycles
- Result: Maximum spanning forest (may have multiple components)
- Time: O(m log m)

**Step 2: Query Path Minimum on Tree**
- For query (x, y): find minimum edge weight on tree path from x to y
- This is where our two methods differ!
- **Method 1:** Binary Lifting (倍增)
- **Method 2:** Heavy-Light Decomposition (树链剖分)

### Speaker Notes

Our solution follows a two-step framework. First, we build the Maximum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's algorithm. We sort all edges by weight in descending order, then greedily add edges that don't create cycles. The result is a maximum spanning forest, which may have multiple connected components if the original graph isn't fully connected. This step takes O(m log m) time, dominated by the sorting operation.

The second step is where things get interesting, and where our two methods diverge. For each query asking about cities x and y, we need to find the minimum edge weight on the tree path connecting them. If they're in different components, we return -1.

This is essentially a Lowest Common Ancestor problem with path aggregation. We've explored two different approaches to solve this efficiently: Binary Lifting and Heavy-Light Decomposition. Both achieve O(log n) query time, but they differ in implementation complexity, space usage, and preprocessing time. Let's examine each method in detail.

## Visual Design Notes

### Slide 1
- **Main diagram:** Show the same graph twice:
  - Left side: Original graph with multiple paths between two nodes
  - Right side: MST with the unique tree path highlighted
  - Use color coding: optimal path in green, suboptimal paths in red/gray
- **Annotation:** Label edge weights clearly
- **Visual proof:** Show how the MST path dominates all other paths

### Slide 2
- **Step 1 visualization:**
  - Show Kruskal's algorithm animation concept (can be a sequence of 3-4 frames)
  - Start with disconnected nodes
  - Add edges one by one (largest first)
  - Show union-find operation concept (merging components)

- **Step 2 comparison:**
  - Split slide into two columns
  - Left: Binary Lifting approach (show the jumping concept)
  - Right: Heavy-Light Decomposition (show chain decomposition concept)
  - Use distinct colors for each method

### Recommended Diagram Data
For a concrete example, use:
```
5 nodes, 7 edges:
(1,2,10), (1,3,8), (2,3,7), (2,4,9), (3,4,6), (3,5,11), (4,5,5)

MST edges (sorted by weight):
(3,5,11), (1,2,10), (2,4,9), (1,3,8)
Total: 4 edges (for 5 nodes)

Query example: (1,5)
Path: 1→3→5
Weights: [8, 11]
Answer: min(8,11) = 8
```
